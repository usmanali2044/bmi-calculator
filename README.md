Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is a simple **BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator** I built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
Itâ€™s a fun little project I made while learning React and how to manage state with `useState`.

- Shows a message based on your BMI category:
  - Underweight

- **Reload button** to reset the form.
